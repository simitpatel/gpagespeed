Description: A way to call the Google Page Speed Insights API
    directly into your R console. The package offers two functions that
    return results the API in the form of a data frame. The first
    function, speedfinder, is to call the results on a single URL, while
    the second function, speedlist, accepts a list of URLs and returns a
    single dataframe with results from the API for all the URLs in the
    list.
